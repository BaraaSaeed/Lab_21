<h2>Software Development</h2>
<p>I started programming with C. I build tons of console-based applications. Unfortunately, the way I learned programming was not the right way. After 4 weeks at Grand Circus, I feel that what I have learned so far has brighed the gap between what I knew years ago and what I should know as a software engineer</p>
